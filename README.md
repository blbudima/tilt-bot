# tilt-bot

**This is the `pc-host` branch. This branch is designed for the bot to be hosted on your local machine.**

Tilt-bot is a simple Discord bot that checks if you are (possibly) tilted. It just checks if you're on a winning or loss streak.

This bot was developed from scratch using [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [cassiopeia](https://github.com/meraki-analytics/cassiopeia).

Use Python 3.

Discord command: `--search <summoner>`
